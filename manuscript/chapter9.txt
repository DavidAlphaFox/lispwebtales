# Modules as reusable components part II: Implementing a reusable module

## Introduction 

In this chapter we'll refactor the user handling code from `linkdemo` out into it's own project, which we can then reuse in other apps as well. 

First, let's create the project:

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
 * (ql:quickload "restas-project")
 * (restas-project:START-RESTAS-PROJECT "authdemo" :depends-on '(:sexml :cl-redis :ironclad :babel))
~~~~~~~~

For simplicity, I'll only implement a redis policy backend, you can add the PostgreSQL backend if you wish.
